TO DO
-----
* Support other Netflix profiles
* Add way to choose different Trakt search result
* Cache state of shows/movies already in sync
* Edit doesn't do anything for movies
* Better handle duplicate episode names (e.g. Great British Baking Show)
* Better highlight skipped things due to unhandled scenarios
